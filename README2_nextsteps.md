** This was a quick (2h) technical challenge (trial)
I am aware that there are some thing that need to be improved and will work on them ASAP.

## Roadmap is the following:
- Linear Regression Model needs improvement. How?
    - [ ] When doing Train Test Split concat Normalized data.
    - [ ] Check why NaN values appear and see how to concat.
    - [ ] Try Model Validation again to see if Error Metrics get better.
