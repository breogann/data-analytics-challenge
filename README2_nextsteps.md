** This was a quick (2h) technical challenge (trial) so I did not have enough time to complete the task as I wish I could.
That's why I will continue working on it after a BREAK (time frame of 12h maybe 1 day... APROX) but wanted to show what I think that should be my next steps to improve the model.**

I am aware that there are some thing that need to be improved and will work on them ASAP.

## Roadmap is the following:
- Linear Regression Model needs improvement. How?
    - [ ] When doing Train Test Split concat Normalized data.
    - [ ] Check why NaN values appear and see how to concat.
    - [ ] Try Model Validation again to see if Error Metrics get better.
